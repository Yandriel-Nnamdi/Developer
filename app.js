//Greetings, code conquerors! Yandriel here, wrapping up our Node odyssey with a final npm flourish. So, Arya and I, armed with npm spells and a dash of courage, unveiled the secret weapon: npm ci. This command is like a superhero swooping in to save the day, ensuring our dependencies are locked and loaded.

//And guess what? The moment of truth arrived â€“ no more stalled code, no more mysterious errors. We did it! Our project runs smoother than a well-oiled machine. Victory dance initiated! Hehehe, Node, you threw your worst at us, but we emerged triumphant.

//Now, here's a final taste of our victorious code:

const victoryDance = require('npm-victory-dance');

const dance = () => {
  // Celebrating our triumph over Node.js
  console.log("Code victory dance - check!");

  // Victory dance loop (because why not?)
  dance();
};

// Initiating the ultimate npm victory dance
dance();
