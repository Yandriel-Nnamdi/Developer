Yo, code wizards! Yandriel is back at it, weaving npm magic into our Node saga. So, Arya and I, armed with newfound npm knowledge, decided to spice up our project with npm run scripts. It's like casting spells on our code, making it dance to our command.

But, lo and behold, we hit a roadblock. Node decided to play hard to get again. No worries, though â€“ we summoned the mighty npm cache clean --force, clearing the path for our code to strut its stuff. Hehehe, Node, you can't outsmart us!

Now, feast your eyes on a slice of our code adventure:

const magicSpell = require('npm-magic-spell');

const castSpell = () => {
  // Casting npm spells for code enchantment
  console.log("Abracadabra, Node, meet our magic!");

  // The enchanting moment
  castSpell();
};

// Unleashing npm magic on our code
castSpell();
